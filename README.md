# Diabetes Detection and Identification of Risk Factors


**Motivation:** Diabetes is considered a global epidemic in today's scenario
with continuously ascending rates yet its laboratory diagnosis can be time
consuming. Therefore, using machine learning based expert methods on publicly 
available healthcare related databases is a great way to discover insights
about the disease.

**Goals:** This project is aimed at designing classifier models that could predict
the likelihood of occurrence of diabetes with utmost accuracy using the
concepts of machine learning based predictive modelling algorithms along
with identifying the risk factors associated with the disease.

**Methods:** The classification networks used were Artificial Neural Networks
(ANN) and Random Forest Ensembles with the experiments being performed
on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset
provided by the National Centre of Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centre
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States.

**Results:** Both the classfiers performed really well on the dataset with the
Neural Network classifier achieving an overall test accuracy of 94.05%, a 
precision score of 0.808 and a recall of 0.584 while the random forest classifier
achieved a test accuracy of 92.93% with a precision score of 0.767.

**Conclusion:** Several features linked to diabetes were identified which highlighted
them as significant determinants for predicting the presence of a diabetic scenario 
in individuals with glucose levels being the predominant one.
The Neural Network classifier outperformed the Random Forest classifier.
